## Conclusion

```
By analyzing the data closely, we have inferred a few of the observations.

•	Google PlayStore has 2 types of applications, mainly Free and Paid.

•	There are various categories amongst which there are multiple applications- Three major apps are Family, Tools and Games.

•	Applications receive both Ratings and Reviews and can be respectively graded too.

•	Applications are installed by various users and mostly installed applications can be found, along with the information of their category, rating, type etc.

•	Business, Game, Family and Tools have the highest number of applications.

•	Free applications make 98% of the total of Applications, with a total count of more than 8000.

•	Communication, Games and Tools are the most installed Application category.

•	Most of the apps with higher rating range of 4.0 4.7 are having high amount of reviews and installs. In terms of price, it doesn't reflect a direct relationship with rating, as we could see a fluctuation in term of pricing even at the range of high

•	Install Counts and Reviews are the most correlated and influence a lot of the downloads

Thus a lot of factors play an important role in the user usage and popularity of any application. It can be because of the price of the application, based of the rating and reviews, also because of the number of installs, which in turn also affects the decision making of any app.
